		"""
		Runs an experiment through core model.

		This method overloads the `run_model` method given in
		the EMA Workbench, and provides the correct execution
		of a core model within the workbench framework.  This
		function assembles and executes the steps laid out in
		other methods of this class, adding some useful logic
		to optimize the process (e.g. optionally short-
		circuiting runs that already have results stored
		in the database).

		For each experiment, the core model is called to:

			1.  `setup` experiment variables, copy files
			    as needed, and otherwise prepare to run the
			    core model for a particular experiment,
			2.  `run` the experiment,
			3.  `post_process` the result if needed to
			    produce all relevant performance measures,
			4.  `archive` model outputs from this experiment
			    (optional), and
			5.  `load_measures` from the experiment and
			    store those measures in the associated database.

		Note that this method does *not* return any outcomes.
		Outcomes are instead written into self.outcomes_output,
		and can be retrieved from there, or from the database at
		a later time.

		In general, it should not be necessary to overload this
		method in derived classes built for particular core models.
		Instead, write overloaded methods for `setup`, `run`,
		`post_process` , `archive`, and `load_measures`.  Moreover,
		in typical usage a modeler will generally not want to rely
		on this method directly, but instead use `run_experiments`
		to automatically run multiple experiments with one command.

		Args:
			scenario (Scenario): A dict-like object that
				has key-value pairs for each uncertainty.
			policy (Policy): A dict-like object that
				has key-value pairs for each lever.

		Raises:
			UserWarning: If there are no experiments associated with
				this type.

		Runs post processors associated with particular performance measures.

		This method is the place to conduct automatic post-processing

		been completed using `setup` and `run`.  If the relevant performance
		measures do not require any post-processing to create (i.e. they

		The default implementation of this method is a no-op, but it is

		Args:
			params (dict):
				Dictionary of experiment variables, with keys as variable names
				and values as the experiment settings. Most post-processing
				scripts will not need to know the particular values of the
				inputs (exogenous uncertainties and policy levers), but this
				method receives the experiment input parameters as an argument

				in order to complete the post-processing.
			measure_names (List[str]):
				List of measures to be processed.  Normally for the first pass
				of core model run experiments, post-processing will be completed
				for all performance measures.  However, it is possible to use
				this argument to give only a subset of performance measures to
				post-process, which may be desirable if the post-processing
				of some performance measures is expensive.  Additionally, this
				method may also be called on archived model results, allowing
				it to run to generate only a subset of (probably new) performance
				measures based on these archived runs.
			output_path (str, optional):
				Path to model outputs.  If this is not given (typical for the
				initial run of core model experiments) then the local/default
				model directory is used.  This argument is provided primarily
				to facilitate post-processing archived model runs to make new
				performance measures (i.e. measures that were not in-scope when
				the core model was actually run).

				If post process is not available for specified measure
